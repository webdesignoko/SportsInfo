                      <h1>European Clubs' Association: What has happened to planned reforms?</h1>
                      <hr id="hr">
                        <p>It was not what the European Clubs' Association (ECA) had envisaged when they met in Malta this summer. Then, they hoped, this week they would be finalising changes that could be passed on to Uefa for rubber stamping ahead of their inception in 2024.</p>
                        <p>
                            The measure of the difficulties ECA chairman Andrea Agnelli and his executive are facing was emphasised in conversations away from their main press conference. The tone differed slightly depending on who was speaking but the overall message was roughly the same. Forget Plan A. Plan B is required but, at this stage, no-one is entirely sure what that should be.
                        </p>
                        <p>Agnelli tried to manage the situation but the Juventus chairman, normally so relaxed, had no definitive answers.

                            It was all rather unsatisfactory and a 35-minute closing press conference came to a fittingly terse end when Agnelli was asked if it was true he had asked the domestic leagues for a reduction in the number of teams who play in them.</p>
                            <p>What is the problem? Agnelli and the ECA believe an overwhelming majority of their member clubs want major reform of European competition.

                                The initial proposal was for three competitions, each with group stages containing four groups of eight clubs, guaranteeing 14 games. Additionally, the idea was to have promotion and relegation between the different competitions.
                            </p>
